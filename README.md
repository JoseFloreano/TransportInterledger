Hackathon Interledger 2025 — Project: Tap&Pay
Problem
Tourists face major payment challenges when traveling to countries with different currencies — they must exchange money, pay high commissions, and carry cash, which increases risk and wastes time. Local vendors also lose sales due to lack of digital infrastructure. For example, in public transport, a tourist without local currency cannot pay, causing delays and losses.
Solution: Tap&Pay
Tap&Pay is a mobile app that enables instant payments via NFC or QR through OpenPayments, without cash or currency concerns. It automatically converts amounts in real time, ensuring speed and security. The vendor enters the price, activates payment mode, the tourist pays by tapping or scanning, and both receive a digital receipt.
Benefits and Impact
Tap&Pay removes cash dependence, accelerates payments, increases security, and promotes financial inclusion. Both tourists and locals use the same app, driving digital adoption. The solution boosts local sales, enhances tourism experiences, and reduces cash reliance, supporting global interoperable payments.
Value Proposition
Tap&Pay is a low-cost, instant cross-border payment platform powered by OpenPayments. It offers convenience for tourists, higher sales for merchants, and scalability for fintech partners. The business model combines a sub-1% transaction fee with premium memberships for frequent vendors.
Technical Description
Frontend: React Native with Expo.
Backend: Node.js with a secure REST API.
Integrations: OpenPayments for currency exchange, native NFC/QR payment modules, ILP protocol for international routing, and MongoDB for data and authentication.
Architecture: App ⇄ OpenPayments API ⇄ ILP Network ⇄ Financial Institutions.
Feasibility
With over 1.4 billion international tourists per year and 95% of smartphones supporting NFC or QR, Tap&Pay enables payments in under 10 seconds with fees below 1% via OpenPayments. Expected adoption: 20% of tourist merchants within six months.
Impact and Sustainability Plan
The rollout starts with pilot programs in airports and markets, partnerships with fintechs and local governments, and digital training for merchants. The model sustains itself through transaction revenue and scalable regional expansion, starting in Latin America.
